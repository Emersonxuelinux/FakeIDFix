Fake ID fix
by Tungstwenty


Fixes the Fake ID vulnerability (bug 13678484).
It allows malicious apps to pretend to be signed from certain trusted providers and be loaded as
supposedly authorized extensions in certain contexts (e.g. NFC management, web plugins from Adobe, etc.)

There is one AOSP commit (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/2bc5e811a817a8c667bca4318ae98582b0ee6dc6)
addressing this, by allowing a more rigorous check of the existing signatures on APKs.
However, due to compatibility problems, Google chose not to use that strict mode in all situations.
This patch enforces the strict validation only when the PM system service is grabbing the signatures as a result
of getPackageInfo() with the GET_SIGNATURES flag, which covers all the known vulnerable vectors such as NFC.

A great explanation of the implications of the bug and how it all works can be found on this article
