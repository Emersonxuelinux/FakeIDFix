    <string name="about_description">This patch fixes the Fake ID vulnerability (bug 13678484).\n\nThe bug allows malicious apps to pretend to be signed by trusted providers and be loaded as extensions
in several contexts, such as NFC access, browser plugins and others, depending on the device and which extension
mechanisms the manufacturer chose to include.
\n
\nA great explanation of the implications and why the problem occurs can be found on <a href="http://bluebox.com/technical/android-fake-id-vulnerability/">this article</a> by
Jeff Forristal from Bluebox.
